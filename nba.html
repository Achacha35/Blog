  <p>The Nba is home to the best of the best basketball players in the world. Dating back to 1946, it has prospered over the years helping peolple achieve their dreams and providing entertainment for most viewers. The Nba playoffs are one of the most viewed 'events'in the world. This is because only the best perfroming gteams of the season make it to the playoffs. These close games provide thrill and anxiety to both the players and their teams, and that is where you see why the best players are called 'The Best'. I, personally, am a strong supporter of the Cleveland Cavaliers led by the king himself,Lebron James.</p>

  <p>Leading the Cavs to their first nba title win in a <strong>long</strong> time, he has proved his worth to the entire league. Many label him as 'unstoppable' especially while driving to the rim. His spectacular dunks and game-winning shots has put him into consideration whether he is truly the best player in the league.I believe he is.</p>

  <p>The Nba is home to the best of the best basketball players in the world.
     Dating back to 1946, it has prospered over the years helping peolple achieve
     their dreams and providing entertainment for most viewers. The Nba playoffs
     are one of the most viewed 'events'in the world. This is because only the
     best perfroming gteams of the season make it to the playoffs. These close
     games provide thrill and anxiety to both the players and their teams, and
     that is where you see why the best players are called 'The Best'. I,
     personally, am a strong supporter of the Cleveland Cavaliers led by the
     king himself,Lebron James.</p>

  <p>Leading the Cavs to their first nba title win in a <strong>long</strong>
     time, he has proved his worth to the entire league. Many label him as
     'unstoppable' especially while driving to the rim. His spectacular dunks
     and game-winning shots has put him into consideration whether he is truly
     the best player in the league.I believe he is.</p>

  <p> Drawing up close is the team's point guard,straight from Duke University,
      <strong>Kyrie Irving</strong>.He recently set his game high in career
      points in a playoffs game. With his dazzling and quick handles, he easily
      puts his defender on skates. Regarded as the player with the best handles
      in the league, he is able to drive at will and perform his complex lay-ups.</p>
